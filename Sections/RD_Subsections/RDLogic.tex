This analysis must address a key issue around internal validity. That is, to obtain any causal estimate, it is first necessary to identify treatment and control groups. However, studies that use geographic boundaries as identification mechanisms are open to criticism around how the treatment and control groups are specified. If the treatment and control groups can be defined arbitrarily, then a study may be vulnerable to data mining problems. As a consequence, this analysis uses two definitions of treated and control groups in order to illustrate that our results are robust to these two specifications. 

Our analysis first uses a conditional difference-in-differences model with matching. This method takes as the treated group those precincts living close to an E-ZPass exit toll plaza, who therefore are more likely to have received an exogenous increase in their housing price. Whether ``close'' should mean 5, 10, or 15 miles is unclear \emph{a priori}, and we provide estimates under a plausible range of values. For the distance calculations, we use a network distance optimized distance measure (i.e. the minimum distance one would have to drive from the precinct center to the nearest E-ZPass plaza). We must also define a reasonable control group that could have received a reduction in traffic via E-ZPass but did not. To construct this control group, we examine precincts close to exits on major highways without E-ZPass tolls. However, some precincts are both within 10 miles of an E-ZPass and 10 miles of an exit to a highway without E-ZPass. Thus, in order to get genuine separation of treatment and control groups, we create a rule excluding those precincts that are in one testing group but are on the cusp of being on the other. Clearly, the exclusion rule should have a radius at least as big as the inclusion rule to get true separation. But one should also be concerned that citizens may be willing to drive further to take a non-toll road than one with tolls (i.e. in citizens' everyday experience, perceived ``closeness'' to an E-ZPass exit may differ from perceived ``closeness'' to a non-E-Z-Pass exit). As a result, the radius of the exclusion rule should, according to this line of reasoning, be larger than the radius of the inclusion rule. At the same time, if it is too large, one will then exclude too many units, particularly those in suburban areas where many different highways intersect. While, in principle, treatment and control groups could each have their own inclusion and exclusion rules, we shall assume that treatment and control each have the same rule for inclusion and the same rule for exclusion. This approach has the benefit of consistency. Moreover, rather than presenting a single, arbitrarily chosen difference-and-difference estimate, we provide estimates for our main effect under a plausible grid of inclusion and exclusion values. 

Our analysis next uses an instrumental variables (IV) approach. This method does not posit the existence of a separate treated and control group. Rather, we use distance to an E-ZPass toll plaza as an instrument for housing price appreciation for those precincts within some fixed distance from the toll plaza. This framework depends on two assumptions. First, distance to E-ZPass toll plaza must be correlated with the endogenous explanatory variable (i.e. gain in housing price). This correlation is strong (with a $t$-statistic of over $20$). Next, the instrument cannot be correlated with the error term of our explanatory equation predicting change in Democratic $2$-party vote share. This assumption would be violated if distance to E-ZPass toll plazas affected Democratic $2$-party vote share even when housing prices are kept constant. 

In what follows, we show that our results are robust to the specification of the treated and control groups, as well as to the method of inference. We have a slight preference for the conditional difference-in-difference approach because this specification of treated and control groups seems more natural. Areas $2$ vs. $10$ km from an E-ZPass toll plaza may be more systematically different from each other than precincts near E-ZPass toll plazas and those near non-E-ZPass traffic exits. Even so, it is important to give careful thought to the specification of the treated and control groups in geographically-based analyses, and it is best to show the robustness of a result across a range of specifications.  We also take care to show that other important predictors of Democratic support (such as race and income) do not undergo significant changes following the introduction of E-ZPass.
